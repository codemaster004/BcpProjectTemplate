/*
 * ? What is stage?
 * ? "The time should be displayed along with the information about implemented requirements." yyy wtf?
 * ? "Character movement and control parameters should be easy to change to achieve smooth control." wtf?
 * ? Menu: Read
 * ? Menu: Check results
 * ? Menu: Save, save what?
 * ? Is there any particular order we are supposed to complete those requirements?
 * ? what does animation mean? do we have to prepare a few versions of a "resource" (i.e. character) and be changing them
 * ?
